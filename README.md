# Seasonal Additions
This mod aims to add new features based around different times of the year and the holidays that occur during them.\
Currently this mod contains only Winter themed items, but it will be expanded upon going forward.

## Winter
The following additions are themed around Winter.

### Christmas Chests
Christmas Chests have been expanded to include all variants of chest each with their own unique style.
All other chest instances have been edited too to now show up as Christmas variants during the season.
Along with this, the timeframe to see these variants has been expanded too, it now covers the entirety of December.

### Ice and Snow Expansion
New blocks made using ice and snow blocks have been added.\
The ice variants act as stone blocks but with unique ice textures to fit into any ice palace build.\
The snow variants allow for more detailed snow piles as well as snow forts for your snowball fights.\
These new variants are all made at a Stonecutter, however, in the future the Icecutter will be the only way to obtain them. Currently, the Icecutter acts as a more snowy version of the Stonecutter.

### Frosted Glowstone
This new light source shines a bit dimmer than regular Glowstone as it has been combined with ice.\
This means that it won't melt any ice or snow near it, allowing for a fitting light source for icy builds.
The dust used to make it can also be brewed into the Frosty Potion, this potion applies slowness and weakness when used.

### Candy Cane
A new block type added, Candy Cane blocks come in red and green and have stairs and slabs to match.\
You craft these blocks by creating the new Candy Cane food item. This requires Red Dye, Sugar and Resin Clumps and also the new Peppermint found from Peppermint Bushes in Snowy Plains.

### Fairy Lights
These are a new wall decoration and like Frosted Glowstone don't shine bright enough to melt ice and snow. They currently come in four variants red, green, white and a festive version that mixes those three colours.
